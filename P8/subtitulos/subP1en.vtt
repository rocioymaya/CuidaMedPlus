00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.801
Welcome to this accessible
presentation of our website

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:09.143
CUIDAMET Plus,
a mini

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.743
thought health encyclopedia

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.996
to provide clear, reliable,
and easy-to-use information.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.730
In this video we will explain
its structure,

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.823
how to navigate it
and what content

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.636
we can find.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.190
At the top you will find a table
of contents

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.243
that allows us to quickly
access

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.321
to different sections
of the page, for example, by making

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:30.496
click on main theme.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.443
This table is held in a fixed position
within the header,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.163
which improves accessibility

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.536
and makes it easy to navigate
without losing the reference.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.003
We can also see in the center
of the page

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.083
the options to first access

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.110
to a brief introduction
about us,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.176
which explains the goal
of the site.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.150
Second, access the website map.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.310
This allows you to access
all the content in a structured way.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.163
Finally, the contact section
with the telephone and mail

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.416
to make inquiries.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.813
Below is the letter index,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.146
that works like an alphabetical
encyclopedia.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.573
You can press the letter
of interest

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.746
to access the corresponding items.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320
For example, if we press
the letter a,

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:18.133
we can access an article
about the alarm and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.666
review the contents.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.170
In the main topic section
there are featured articles,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.773
for example, 1 is shown here

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.653
about healthy food with pictures,
explanations

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.133
and an educational approach

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.306
scientific evidence.
