00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.633
Hello, are we Maya Beese and Rocío
Marcos

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.667
and today we're going to talk
about digital health, how to

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.167
take care of our mind and body when we spend
a lot of time

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.000
on the screens

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.767
In our day to day we use screens
for everything,

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:16.233
to work, study and entertain
ourselves.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.767
This makes us spend
many hours in a row

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.500
in front of devices without realizing it.

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.033
This prolonged use
has consequences,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.067
can cause eyestrain, back pain,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.500
insomnia and also increase stress,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.100
that's why it's important
to learn how to manage it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.333
Some simple habits
can go a long way,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.833
walk a few minutes every so often,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.733
get up and stretch
your arms

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.300
and relax your eyes looking away
for a few seconds.

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:48.000
It's also critical to have
a good workspace,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.867
with good lighting and

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.267
an ergonomic chair
to avoid bad postures.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.800
In addition, we must learn
to disconnect from screens,

00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.933
sleep well, read or dedicate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.567
time to non-tech activities

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.767
always helps to balance
our mental health.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.533
It's not about avoiding
technology,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.867
but use it with balance
so it doesn't affect

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:09.800
to our well-being.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.033
In short, care for your body,
care for your mind

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.067
and apply small routines
that mark a

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:15.767
difference.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:17.967
